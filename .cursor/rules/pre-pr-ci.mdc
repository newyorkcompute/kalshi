# Pre-PR CI Check

**ALWAYS run `npm run ci` before creating a PR.** This command runs build, lint, test, and typecheck for all packages in the monorepo.

```bash
npm run ci
```

## What it checks

- `build` - TypeScript compilation for all packages
- `lint` - ESLint checks
- `test` - Vitest unit tests  
- `typecheck` - TypeScript type checking (without emit)

## Requirements

1. All checks must pass before opening a PR
2. If any check fails, fix the issues before proceeding
3. Do NOT create a PR with known CI failures
